# FoodRepo products data analysis 

In this repo we perform an exploratory and unsupervised data analysis of the [food repo](https://www.openfood.ch)
dataset.
 
 There are mainly 4 works, in the corresponding notebooks:
 
* [exploratory analysis with general statistics](exploratory_analysis_on_large_dataset.ipynb)  > plots also in [plots\_nutrients](./plots_nutrients)
* [clustering in nutrients space](clustering_nutrients.ipynb)
* [network-based analysis on ingredients](ingredients_network.ipynb) > plots in [ingredients\_network\_plots](./ingredients_network_plots)
* [network-based analysis on products](product_network.ipynb) >  plots in [products\_network\_plots](./products_network_plots)
